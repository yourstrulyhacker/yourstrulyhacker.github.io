<h3 class="post-title">What is Domain Name</h3>
<div class="post-content">
<p>
A<strong><em> domain name is your website name</em></strong>. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.
</p>
<p>
The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one else's.
</p>
<p>
The price of a domain name typically runs between $15-25(Rs.1101.9 - Rs.1836.5) per year.

<h3 class="post-title">What is VPN </h3>
<div class="post-content">
<p>A <em>virtual private network </em><strong><em>(VPN)</em></strong> extends a <em>private network across a public network</em> and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a<strong><em> VPN </em></strong>may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. <em>Encryption</em> is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection. </p>
<p>
You can Simply Use VPN By Clicking on the Link Below and Downloading Any Application of Your Choice
Some of them are :- <br>

<p> There are 2 types of <strong><em>VPN Services</em></strong> that are Provided to you :-

<h3 class="post-title"> What is Web Hosting </h3>
<div class="post-content">
<p>
Web hosting is the process of renting or buying space to house a website on the World Wide Web. Website content such as HTML, CSS, and images has to be housed on a server to be viewable online. </p>

<p>When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files, they are hosting a website. Web hosting makes the files that comprise a website (code, images, etc.) available for viewing online. Every website you?ve ever visited is hosted on a server. </p>



<p>The amount of space allocated on a server to a website depends on the type of hosting. The main types of hosting are shared, dedicated, VPS and reseller. They are differentiated by the kind of technology used for the server, the level of management provided and the additional services on offer.
 </p>


<p>
A server is a computer that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world. As the name implies, web hosting service providers have the servers, connectivity, and associated services to host websites. By offering a variety of hosting plans, they cover the spectrum of hosting needs, from small blogs and large organizations. </p>

<p> A domain name is an essential part of having a website, but it's only part of the equation. In order to launch a website, you'll also need content and a hosting service to store your files so they can be accessed on the internet. Remember that owning a domain does not mean hosting is also included.</p>



<p> So for Connecting Both these things (Domain and Hosting)with Each other you need to Login to the CPanel of your Registrar from where you bought the Domain and the Settings of your Hosting Site. </p>

<p> Then Once Logged in, <br>

Check from which method you have to point the name server or DNS of your Domain to the  Hosting Website .
</p>
<p>
 In Some Cases you have to change the Name Server of your Domain to the Name Server of the Hosting Website. 

</p>
<p> 
While in Other Cases You have to Change the DNS.</p>

<p> Once Done , wait for 3-5 hours(DNS  or Name Server change can also be identified in a few minutes in Some Hosting Websites)</p>

<p> Then Once Done You are Ready to bring your Website Online with WordPress or By Coding Everything Yourself.
