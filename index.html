<h3 class="post-title">What is Domain Name</h3>
<div class="post-content">
<p>
A<strong><em> domain name is your website name</em></strong>. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.
</p>
<p>
The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one else's.
</p>
<p>
The price of a domain name typically runs between $15-25(Rs.1101.9 - Rs.1836.5) per year.

<h3 class="post-title">What is VPN </h3>
<div class="post-content">
<p>A <em>virtual private network </em><strong><em>(VPN)</em></strong> extends a <em>private network across a public network</em> and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a<strong><em> VPN </em></strong>may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. <em>Encryption</em> is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection. </p>
