<div class="post-content">
<p>
If you are the one who is interested to know about how to make a Blog from Scratch then this is the right article for you . <br>
Before that I want to tell you that there is soon going to be a video series starting on Yours Truly Hacker YouTube Channel about Web Development . So do watch that to know about Web Development .
</p>
<p>
So let's begin today's lesson ..... <br>
After reading the full article you will know about 2 Computer Languages :- <br>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>
Below is the basic structure of HTML :- <br>
<img src="basicstructure.jpg "> <br>
Write this much Code in your Text Editor . If you don't have a text editor then you can install <a href="https://atom.io ">Atom Text Editor </a> for Windows / Mac / Linux Operating Systems . If you are using Android Device then you can install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonylim.jnotepad ">Just Notepad</a> as a Text Editor . 
</p>
<p>
After Writing this much Save the file name as index.html . Make a Folder named <strong><em>Blog</em></strong> and save the index.html file in that folder . 
</p>
<p>
You need a <em>Browser</em> so that you can view your demo blog on your Computer . 
If you are on a Windows / Linux Machine then these are the Best Choices :- <br>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
</ul>
If you are on a Mac Machine then <strong>Safari</strong> is the Best Choice .
If you are on Android then the inbuilt <strong>Chrome</strong> Browser is enough for you along with <em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.android.globalFileexplorer">Mi File Manager</a></em>.
</p>
<p>
[For Computer]Open the File Manager on your Computer and then open the <em>Blog</em> Folder . Then right click on the index.html file and open it in your Browser . <br>
[For Android] Open the Mi File Manager and Search for the <em>Blog</em> Folder . Open the folder and click on the check box of index.html file and then tap on more and then tap <em>Details</em> . From there , Copy the Location of the file which will be in blue colour . Open the Chrome Browser and paste the location in the Search Box and then click Search . <br>
So now you have your Blog on the Browser . Remember that this Blog is stored on your Computer and not on the internet .
</p>
<p>
So now that you have Setup your Environment , we can start doing the real job which is Coding .
